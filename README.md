# `RAG` Basics

The **RAG-Basics** repository provides a compact yet practical foundation for learning and experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows. It includes Jupyter notebooks like _typesense.ipynb_ (showcasing Typesense-based retrieval) and _RAGfromScratch.ipynb_ (a step-by-step build of a basic RAG pipeline), a lightweight `src/` module for extensibility, and diverse datasets under `data/`â€”with PDFs (_attention.pdf_, _YOLO.pdf_), text files (_python_intro.txt_, _ML_intro.txt_), and a Chroma vector store (`chroma.sqlite3` with supporting binary files) to demonstrate indexing and retrieval. Additionally, it contains `books.jsonl` as a structured dataset, `test.txt` as an embedding test file, and `requirements.txt` to set up the environment seamlessly. Together, these assets form a self-contained ecosystem where one can explore ingestion of varied formats, experiment with vector search, and run end-to-end RAG pipelines directly from the notebooks. _Acknowledgement: Special thanks to [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06) for inspiration and guidance on foundational AI and GenAI practices._
