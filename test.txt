Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing by 
proposing the Transformer architecture. The key insight was the use of self-attention mechanisms to replace recurrent 
and convolutional operations, thereby allowing parallelization and better handling of long-range dependencies.

The Transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multi-head self-attention, position-wise feedforward 
networks, residual connections, and positional encodings. The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores using 
the scaled dot-product between queries, keys, and values, enabling the model to weigh contextual relevance dynamically.

Following this, large-scale pretrained models based on the Transformer architecture such as GPT (Generative Pretrained 
Transformers) emerged. GPT models (Radford et al., 2018–2024) use a decoder-only Transformer architecture with masked 
self-attention to perform autoregressive language modeling. Pretraining on massive corpora allows GPT models to capture 
linguistic, semantic, and contextual patterns, which can then be fine-tuned or prompted for downstream tasks.

The scaling laws of Transformers demonstrate that model performance continues to improve predictably with more 
parameters, data, and compute. GPT-3 (175B parameters) showed unprecedented few-shot learning capabilities, while GPT-4 
and beyond improved reasoning, factual accuracy, and multimodal integration. Key techniques such as Reinforcement Learning 
from Human Feedback (RLHF), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction tuning further enhanced controllability 
and user alignment.

Transformers are now the foundation for state-of-the-art models in NLP, vision (ViT), speech, and multimodal AI. 
Their flexibility, scalability, and representational power make them the backbone of modern AI systems.

The Transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multi-head self-attention, position-wise feedforward 
networks, residual connections, and positional encodings. The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores using 
the scaled dot-product between queries, keys, and values, enabling the model to weigh contextual relevance dynamically.

Following this, large-scale pretrained models based on the Transformer architecture such as GPT (Generative Pretrained 
Transformers) emerged. GPT models (Radford et al., 2018–2024) use a decoder-only Transformer architecture with masked 
self-attention to perform autoregressive language modeling. Pretraining on massive corpora allows GPT models to capture 
linguistic, semantic, and contextual patterns, which can then be fine-tuned or prompted for downstream tasks.

The scaling laws of Transformers demonstrate that model performance continues to improve predictably with more 
parameters, data, and compute. GPT-3 (175B parameters) showed unprecedented few-shot learning capabilities, while GPT-4 
and beyond improved reasoning, factual accuracy, and multimodal integration. Key techniques such as Reinforcement Learning 
from Human Feedback (RLHF), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction tuning further enhanced controllability 
and user alignment.

Transformers are now the foundation for state-of-the-art models in NLP, vision (ViT), speech, and multimodal AI. 
Their flexibility, scalability, and representational power make them the backbone of modern AI systems.

the scaled dot-product between queries, keys, and values, enabling the model to weigh contextual relevance dynamically.

Following this, large-scale pretrained models based on the Transformer architecture such as GPT (Generative Pretrained 
Transformers) emerged. GPT models (Radford et al., 2018–2024) use a decoder-only Transformer architecture with masked 
self-attention to perform autoregressive language modeling. Pretraining on massive corpora allows GPT models to capture 
linguistic, semantic, and contextual patterns, which can then be fine-tuned or prompted for downstream tasks.

The scaling laws of Transformers demonstrate that model performance continues to improve predictably with more 
parameters, data, and compute. GPT-3 (175B parameters) showed unprecedented few-shot learning capabilities, while GPT-4 
and beyond improved reasoning, factual accuracy, and multimodal integration. Key techniques such as Reinforcement Learning 
from Human Feedback (RLHF), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction tuning further enhanced controllability 
and user alignment.

Transformers are now the foundation for state-of-the-art models in NLP, vision (ViT), speech, and multimodal AI. 
Their flexibility, scalability, and representational power make them the backbone of modern AI systems.

Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing by 
proposing the Transformer architecture. The key insight was the use of self-attention mechanisms to replace recurrent 
and convolutional operations, thereby allowing parallelization and better handling of long-range dependencies.

The Transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder structure with multi-head self-attention, position-wise feedforward 
networks, residual connections, and positional encodings. The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores using 
the scaled dot-product between queries, keys, and values, enabling the model to weigh contextual relevance dynamically.
